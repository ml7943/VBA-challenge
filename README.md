# VBA-challenge
This folder contains all the files required for submission of Module 2 assignment. 
It includes an xlsm file that contains the code and the resulting data analysis, three screenshots of the results for the years 2018-2020, and a separate file with the code that can be opened using txt or VS Code etc..

In the xlsm file, on the first sheet which represents the data for the year 2018, you will find two buttons labeled "Method1" and "Method2". Clicking these buttons will run the code for two different methods on all three sheets, producing the same results.
